# Event_Driven_Loan_Evaluation
This is my attempt to learn about event-driven architecture in .NET by building a Loan Evaluation platform

## Getting Started
This is how you set up and run the project locally in your environment.
1. Download and set up Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).
2. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/vinhngogia0906/Event_Driven_Loan_Evaluation.git
```
3. In the repository, run this command to build and spin up the platform's Docker containers:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
4. Make sure all the services are running before testing
